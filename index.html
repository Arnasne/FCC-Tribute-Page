                    The Nobel Prize is an annual prize awarded to people or organizations for important achievements in

                Nobel Prizes are awarded in the fields of Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, Literature, and
                Peace
                (Nobel characterized the Peace Prize as "to the person who has done the most or best to advance
                fellowship
                among nations, the abolition or reduction of standing armies, and the establishment and promotion of
                peace
                congresses"). Nobel Prizes are widely regarded as the most prestigious awards available in their
                respective
                fields.

            <p class="paragraph">
                Each year, special committees within the institutions that select the Nobel laureates conduct surveys of
                scientists from various countries in a certain field to find out what they would recommend for the
                award.
                Selected applicants are put forward for a wider vote, which takes place in October, and the winners are
                announced immediately after the votes are counted. The prizes are awarded on the day of Nobel's death -
                December 10. The prize consists of a gold medal, a diploma and a sum of money, currently around 1
                million
                euros. If several people are awarded a bonus in a certain area that year, the bonus money is divided
                equally.

                    Alfred Nobel was born on 21 October 1833 in Stockholm, Sweden. He was a Swedish chemist, engineer,
                    and
                    industrialist most famously known for the invention of
                    dynamite. He died in December 10 1896. In his will, he bequeathed all of his "remaining realisable
                    assets"
                    to be used to
                    establish five prizes which became known as "Nobel Prizes." Nobel Prizes were first awarded in 1901.
